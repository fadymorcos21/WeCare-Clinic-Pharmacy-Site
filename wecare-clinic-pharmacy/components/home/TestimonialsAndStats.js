I wanted a second opinion so went to WeCare. Within 5 min doc had a requisition to get blood work and an ultrasound to get to the bottom of things. That's the level of care you get here. Just go. They are top notch.",

The latest pharmacist that they have ( old lady with curly hair) is superb- takes good time to explain before delivering medications.",
